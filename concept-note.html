    <!-- 1. STRATEGIC CONTEXT -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. Strategic context</div>
      <h2>From AI model risk to AI systemic risk</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For many years, AI and machine learning have been discussed mainly as
        <b>model risk</b>: local errors, biases, lack of explainability or poor data
        quality. As adoption increases across financial institutions, market
        infrastructures, cloud providers and critical sectors, a broader question
        emerges: can AI become a <b>source of systemic risk</b>?
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">Concentration of key models, data pipelines and infrastructures in a limited number of providers.</div>
        <div class="chip">Herding and pro-cyclicality when many institutions rely on similar AI systems, data or signals.</div>
        <div class="chip">Cross-sector interdependencies: AI embedded simultaneously in finance, energy, logistics, telecoms and platforms.</div>
        <div class="chip">New transmission channels for shocks (e.g. automation cascades, correlated failures, coordinated attacks).</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        In this context, supervisors, financial-stability boards, central banks and
        systemic institutions increasingly need a <b>shared language</b> to discuss “AI
        systemic risk” in a way that goes beyond individual models or projects.
        <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> is a descriptive .com that brings this phrase
        front and centre as a <b>neutral banner</b> for programmes, observatories,
        indices or analytical suites dedicated to this topic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. DESCRIPTIVE VIEW OF "AI SYSTEMIC RISK" -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">2. A descriptive view of “AI systemic risk”</div>
      <h2>What the banner can cover (without prescribing a framework)</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without endorsing any particular standard or supervisory approach, “AI
        systemic risk” can be used descriptively to refer to several intertwined
        themes:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>System-wide amplification:</b> ways in which AI can propagate local shocks into market-wide or sector-wide disruptions.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Common dependencies:</b> reliance of many institutions on the same models, datasets, APIs, clouds or vendors.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Critical third parties:</b> systemic exposure to a small number of external providers of AI, data and infrastructure.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Cross-sector contagion:</b> channels through which AI failures or misuse in one sector can affect others.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Governance &amp; oversight:</b> how Boards, risk committees, regulators and financial-stability bodies oversee these new forms of risk.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        A banner such as <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> does not define the answers. It
        provides a <b>clear label</b> under which institutions can publish their own
        analyses, frameworks, indicators and supervisory expectations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. WHY A NEUTRAL BANNER MATTERS -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. Why a neutral banner matters</div>
      <h2>Separating systemic-risk governance from vendor branding</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Many debates on AI are dominated by vendor brands, proprietary product
        names and technical jargon. Systemic-risk discussions, however, belong to a
        different layer, closer to <b>macro-prudential policy, supervision and public
        interest</b>. They require a vocabulary that is neutral, durable and readable
        by non-technical decision-makers.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        A neutral label like <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> can help:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">Signal that the focus is on <b>systemic risk and financial stability</b>, not on selling AI tools.</div>
        <div class="chip">Offer a <b>long-lived home</b> for observatories, indices, dashboards, consultations and reports.</div>
        <div class="chip">Provide a <b>common entry point</b> for central banks, supervisors, industry, academia and civil society.</div>
        <div class="chip">Host dialogues that remain <b>above individual vendors or products</b>.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        The domain name itself does not create authority or legitimacy. Those must
        be earned by the institutions that choose to work under this banner, through
        the quality of their analysis, methodologies and safeguards.

      <h2>How an acquirer might deploy AISystemicRisk.com</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without prescribing any particular model, an acquirer could use
        <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> in several ways:
      </p>

      <h3>4.1. AI Systemic Risk Observatory</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">An “AI Systemic Risk Observatory” mapping initiatives, indicators and supervisory approaches worldwide.</div>
        <div class="chip">Public dashboards showing high-level exposure to AI systemic risk across sectors or jurisdictions.</div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.2. Macro-prudential framework</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">A macro-prudential “AI Systemic Risk Framework” documenting channels of amplification, contagion and concentration.</div>
        <div class="chip">Scenario and stress-testing materials for Boards, financial-stability committees and supervisory colleges.</div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.3. Index or analytical suite</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">An “AI Systemic Risk Index” or “AI Systemic Risk Suite” of indicators for systemic institutions and regulators.</div>
        <div class="chip">Research reports and technical notes for clients, supervisors and investors.</div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.4. Alliance or foundation (with AISystemicRisk.org)</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">A non-profit alliance, observatory or foundation working on AI systemic risk in the public interest.</div>
        <div class="chip">Coordinated work on taxonomies, metrics, disclosures and good practices.</div>
      </div>

      <p class="muted">
        These are <b>illustrative scenarios</b>. This site does not operate such
        programmes. The asset on offer is the <b>domain name</b>; any institutional
        design, methodology, engagement or evaluation built around it is defined and
        owned by the acquirer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. SCOPE & LIMITATIONS -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">5. Scope &amp; limitations of the domain</div>
      <h2>A descriptive digital asset — not a service provider</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        To keep expectations clear and risk low, the positioning of
        <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> is intentionally narrow:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>No risk models or AI systems:</b> the domain is not a model provider, AI platform or trading engine.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>No financial products:</b> it does not issue, trade or distribute securities, derivatives, indices or investment products.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>No data processing:</b> it does not collect, store or process client, trading, operational or personal data.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>No regulatory or supervisory authority:</b> it is not a regulator, supervisor, resolution authority or dispute-resolution body.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>No advice:</b> this page and the main site provide <b>no legal, regulatory, financial, investment or risk advice</b>.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        The aim is to provide a <b>clear semantic space</b>, while leaving complete
        freedom — and responsibility — to the acquirer regarding governance
        structures, analytical work, safeguards and compliance.

    <!-- 6. RELATION TO OTHER SYSTEMIC & SOLVENCY THEMES -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">6. Relation to other systemic &amp; solvency themes</div>
      <h2>AI systemic risk as one layer in a broader agenda</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Discussions about <b>AI systemic risk</b> intersect with a wider agenda on
        solvency, planetary boundaries and digital sovereignty. An acquirer may wish
        to position <b>AISystemicRisk.com</b> alongside other banners dealing with
        climate, nature, biosphere, energy or compute solvency, or with AI and
        digital sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Nothing in this Concept Note creates any obligation to bundle different
        digital assets or to adopt a specific architecture. It simply underlines
        that AI systemic risk is part of a larger conversation about how societies
        oversee powerful AI and data infrastructures in a prudent, resilient and
        transparent way.
